This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with `@apply` directives within custom directives.  The issue is that Tailwind's JIT mode may not correctly process the `@apply` within the custom directives, leading to styles not being applied or unexpected behavior. For example:

```css
@layer components {
  .my-custom-directive {
    @apply bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded;
  }
}
```

If this custom directive is then used elsewhere:

```html
<div class="my-custom-directive">
  Content
</div>
```
The `bg-gray-100`, `p-4`, and `rounded` utility classes might not be applied correctly.
